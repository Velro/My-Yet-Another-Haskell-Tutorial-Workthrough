*** Overview
I'm keeping quick notes on syntax, emacs setup, etc in here as I learn some Haskell
I also haven't used org mode before this project so this is an experiment in using that in a constructive
way as well.

** Keybindings
all based on https://github.com/serras/emacs-haskell-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md

C-c C-l     open interpreter
f8          navigate imports - NOTE: whats this do?
** Interpreter
- use :l for load file, probably based on working directory
after this you can start to query variables

** Chapter 3

* tuples
- fst
- snd
